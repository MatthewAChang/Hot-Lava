# Hot-Lava

Hot Lava is a program that I created for CPSC 221: Basic Algorithms and Data Structures at UBC. The program uses breadth first traversal to find the shortest point between two pixels where the colours of two consecutive pixels do not differ by very much. The program will draw the shortest path onto the image and return a PNG of the edited image.

The program will take images specified in main and output them to the specified location. In this case, the input and output location are the same in /images.
