# Hot-Lava

Hot Lava is a program that I created for CPSC 221: Basic Algorithms and Data Structures at UBC. The program uses breadth first traversal to find the shortest point between two pixels where the colours of two consectutive pixels do not differ by very much. The program will draw the shortest path onto the image and return a PNG of the edited image.
